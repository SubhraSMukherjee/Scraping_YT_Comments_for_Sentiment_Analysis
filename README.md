## Scraping YouTube Comments for Sentiment Analysis


---

This Script is for collecting YouTube comments and their replies and using the Open AI Api to analyse the sentiment and key themes.
Finally create a (basic) PDF Report from the Open AI response. This is a POC project, realistically the workflow would save the comments in some database before pushing them to the LLM APIs and the script usually is automated in a Workflow with the Final formatted PDF sent out to Stakeholders via mail
